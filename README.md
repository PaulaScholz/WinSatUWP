# Desktop Bridge COM Client Self-Elevation Sample

##Developer Incubation and Learning (DIaL)

This mixed UWP and Win32 sample shows how to:

-  Launch a fullTrust background Win32 process from a UWP application that calls COM, with elevation when required, through Desktop Bridge
-  Exchange complex object data through Desktop Bridge using JSON
-  Translate native Win32 HBITMAPs returned by Windows APIs to a format transmissible through Desktop Bridge and use them in UWP UI
-  Windows System Assessment Tool (WinSAT) ratings are the demonstration vehicle for the sample
